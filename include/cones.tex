Perhaps the most essential ingredient for the conception of the idea of holography was the fact that coincident D3-branes (a "stack") naturally feature a 4D gauge theory on their world-volume, where the 4D fields emerge from the modes of open strings stretching between them. In the simplest and most famous example, a stack of $N$ D3-branes is placed in otherwise Minkowski $\mathbb{R}^{1,9}$; the corresponding field theory is the maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills in four dimensions (SYM4).\\

Setting the stack on a different background geometry instead gives rise to a large family of different field theories; a particularly interesting subset is given by spacetimes of the form:

\begin{equation} 
	M = \mathbb{R}^{1,3} \times X_6 
\end{equation}

where the $\mathbb{R}^{1,3}$ is parallel to the branes (and must be identified with the field theory spacetime) and $X_6$ is a 6-dimensional Calabi-Yau cone over a compact 5-fold base $Y_5$. In this language, the SYM4 example above corresponds to $X_6 = \mathbb{R}^6 = \mathbb{C}^3$, which is (trivially) a cone over $\mathbb{S}^5$. This is the only case where $X_6$ turns out to be smooth; in general it will feature a conical singularity in the origin. Other choices for the base will typically yield theories with reduced (even minimal) supersymmetry, which are considerably more challenging to study.

\section{Brane stack in $\mathbb{C}^3$ and $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills}

If $X_6 = \mathbb{C}^3$, the branes are invariant under half of the $16 \times 2 = 32$ IIB supercharges. The only possibility for a 4D theory to have $16$ supercharges is to be an $\mathcal{N}=4$, superconformal field theory\footnote{Indeed, the number of supercharges is $2$ for the components of a 4D Majorana spinor, times $\mathcal{N}$, times a factor of $2$ since the superconformal algebra has twice the supercharges of the usual SUSY algebra.}. Moreover, the theory features gluons as the massless spin-1 modes for the sector of strings stretching between brane $i$ and brane $j$ so that the gauge group is $U(N)$, as seen in \ref{sec:branestacks}. The information that the theory is a $U(N)$ gauge theory and is maximally supersymmetric is enough to uniquely fix it.\\

In $\mathcal{N}=1$ language (which we employ even though the model has $\mathcal{N}=4$) the theory describes the dynamics of $U(N)$ gauge vector supermultiplets $A_\mu$ and three complex chiral superfields $(X^a)_{i\dot j}$, $a=1,2,3$ in the adjoint of the gauge group (we will frequently omit gauge indices). These are nothing else than the parametrization of the D3-branes' position in $\mathbb{C}^3$ and therefore transform in the fundamental of $SU(3)$. The superpotential is the only one allowed by gauge and $SU(3)$ invariance:

\begin{equation} W(X) = \epsilon_{abc} \Tr ( X^a X^b X^c) \end{equation}

\section{The conifold and the Klebanov-Witten model}

In \cite{KW_SCFT} the case of $X_6$ being the conifold was studied. The conifold is a specific Calabi-Yau 3-cone defined for example as the following variety in $\mathbb{C}^4$:

\begin{equation}
	z_1^2 + z_2^2 + z_3^2 + z_4^2 = 0
\end{equation}

The base can be found by quotienting by dilations $z_i \rightarrow \lambda z_i$ (with $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}_+$) and turns out to be the homogeneous space $SO(4)/U(1) = SU(2)\times SU(2) / U(1)$, where the $U(1)$ is a diagonal subgroup generated by, say, $T^3_L + T^3_R$. We will therefore have $SU(2)\times SU(2)$ as part of the isometry group of both $Y_5$ and $X_6$, and thus will also appear as a global symmetry of the wordvolume theory. An equivalent description of the topology of the conifold is as a $U(1)$ bundle over $\mathbb{C}P^1 \times \mathbb{C}P^1$; in these terms the metric on the base that makes the cone Calabi-Yau is

\begin{equation}
	ds^2_5 = \frac{1}{9} (d\psi + \cos\theta_1 d\phi_1 + \cos\theta_2 d\phi_2)^2 + \frac{1}{6} (d\Omega_1^2 + d\Omega_2^2)
\end{equation}

where $\Omega_i^2 = d\theta_i^2 + \sin\theta_i^2 d\phi_i^2$ is the metric on the $\mathbb{C}P^1_i$, and $\psi$ is the fibral coordinate with period $4\pi$.\\

The corresponding gauge field theory on the worldvolume is a $U(N)\times U(N)$ field theory featuring two chiral doublets $A_i$, $B_j$ with $i,j = 1,2$ transforming in opposite bifundamentals, that is $A_i$ in $(N,\bar N)$ and $B_j$ in $(\bar N, N)$. Or more succintly, this can be depicted in a quiver diagram:

\cmmnt{~\\Inserire diagramma\\}

The $i$ and $j$ indices, instead, are acted upon respectively by the global left and right $SU(2)$ symmetries. Finally, $A$ and $B$ have R-charge $1/2$. The symmetries and R-charges fix the form of the superpotential:

\begin{equation}
	W = \frac{\lambda}{2} \epsilon^{ij} \epsilon^{kl} \Tr \left( A_i B_k A_j B_l \right)
	\label{}
\end{equation}

While this theory won't be in general superconformal, unlike the $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM seen before, it will flow through renormalization in the IR to a conformal submanifold in the space of couplings $(\lambda,g_1,g_2)$, the locus where the $\beta$ functions for these three couplings vanish. It turns out these three conditions are all equivalent. In particular, requiring $\beta_{g_1} = 0$ and making use of the NSVZ expression for the $\beta$ function of a supersymmetric gauge theory, this unique condition is equivalent to


\begin{equation}
	3 T[\mathrm{Adj}] - \sum_i T[R_i] ( 1- 2\gamma_i) = 0
	\label{}
\end{equation}

where $T[R]$ is the Dynkin invariant of representation $R$, the sum is over charged fields and $\gamma_i$ is the anomalous dimension\footnote{Note we use the definition $\gamma = -\frac{1}{2}\frac{d\ln Z}{d \ln \mu}$, where $\sqrt Z$ renormalizes the field.}. When evaluating this, care should be taken with the fact that $A_i$ and $B_j$ have a $U(N)_2$ index which is uncharged under $U(N)_1$ and must be summed over. This gives, also noting $\gamma_{A_1} = \gamma_{A_2}$ and the same for $B$ because of the global symmetry:

\begin{equation}
	\gamma_A + \gamma_B + \frac{1}{2} = 0
	\label{}
\end{equation}

Being $\gamma_{A,B}$ functions of the couplings, this equation defines a critical 2-surface in parameter space. We note this equation is consistent with the relationship $\frac{3}{2}R-1 = \gamma$ between R-charge and the anomalous dimension of an operator in a SCFT, with the given assignment of R-charges.

\section{The $Y^{(2,0)}$ orbifold theory}\label{sec:squares}

The same construction on a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold of the conifold yields a quiver gauge theory which will be the main interest of this work. The geometry of the cone is very simply introduced in polar coordinates as 

\begin{equation}
	ds^2_5 = \frac{1}{9} (d\psi + \cos\theta_1 d\phi_1 + \cos\theta_2 d\phi_2)^2 + \frac{1}{6} (d\Omega_1^2 + d\Omega_2^2)
\end{equation}

i.e., exactly the same metric in form as the conifold, but with $\psi$ now with period $2\pi$. This background and the resulting worldvolume field theory are just one entry $Y^{2,0}$ of an infinite class $Y^{p,q}$ of examples introduced in \cite{benvenutiInfinite}.\\

The quiver diagram ``splits'' to yield four bifundamental chiral fields stretching in a square between four nodes:\\

\cmmnt{inserire diagramma}\\

and the superpotential can be shown to have the form

\begin{equation}
	W = \lambda \epsilon^{ij} \epsilon^{kl} \Tr\left( A_i B_k C_j D_l \right)
	\label{}
\end{equation}

from which it's clear that the $SU(2) \times SU(2)$ isometry of the cone, corresponding to a global symmetry of the field theory, must now act with the left factor on $A_i$ and $C_i$, and the right on $B_i$ and $D_i$. This time three of the four gauge $\beta$ functions are independent:

\begin{align}
	\gamma_A + \gamma_D + \frac{1}{2} = 0 \\
	\gamma_B + \gamma_A + \frac{1}{2} = 0 \\
	\gamma_C + \gamma_B + \frac{1}{2} = 0 \\
\end{align}

$\beta_\lambda = 0$ is also not independent. At any superconformal point, $\frac{3}{2}R - 1 = \gamma$, so that the condition that $W$ be scale invariant, which is equivalent to it having R-charge $2$, becomes

\begin{equation}
	2 = R_W = R_A + R_B + R_C + R_D \Rightarrow \gamma_A + \gamma_B + \gamma_C + \gamma_D + 1 = 0
	\label{}
\end{equation}

which is indeed equivalent to the above system. Three independent equations in a five-parameter space define, again, a critical 2-submanifold.
