Perhaps the most essential ingredient for the conception of the idea of holography was the fact that coincident D3-branes (a "stack") naturally feature a 4D gauge theory on their world-volume, where the 4D fields emerge from the modes of open strings stretching between them. In the simplest and most famous example, a stack of $N$ D3-branes is placed in otherwise Minkowski $\mathbb{R}^{1,9}$; the corresponding field theory is the maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills in four dimensions (SYM4).\\

Setting the stack on a different background geometry instead gives rise to a large family of different field theories; a particularly interesting subset is given by spacetimes of the form:

\begin{equation} M = \mathbb{R}^{1,3} \times X_6 \end{equation}

where the $\mathbb{R}^{1,3}$ is parallel to the branes (and must be identified with the field theory spacetime) and $X_6$ is a 6-dimensional Calabi-Yau cone over a compact 5-fold base $Y_5$. In this language, the SYM4 example above corresponds to $X_6 = \mathbb{R}^6 = \mathbb{C}^3$, which is (trivially) a cone over $\mathbb{S}^5$. This is the only case where $X_6$ turns out to be smooth; in general it will feature a conical singularity in the origin. Other choices for the base will typically yield theories with reduced (even minimal) supersymmetry, which are considerably more challenging to study.

\section{Brane stack in $\mathbb{C}^3$ and $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills}

If $X_6 = \mathbb{C}^3$, the branes are invariant under half of the $16 \times 2 = 32$ IIB supercharges. The only possibility for a 4D theory to have $16$ supercharges is to be an $\mathcal{N}=4$, superconformal field theory\footnote{Indeed, the number of supercharges is $2$ for the components of a 4D Majorana spinor, times $\mathcal{N}$, times a factor of $2$ since the superconformal algebra has twice the supercharges of the usual SUSY algebra.}. Moreover, the theory features gluons as the massless spin-1 modes for string stretching between brane $i$ and brane $j$ ($i$ and $j$ being called Chan-Paton indices),\cmmnt{gi√† detto} so that the gauge group is $U(N)$, and the Chan-Paton indices lie in the fundamental. The information that the theory is a $U(N)$ gauge theory and is maximally supersymmetric is enough to uniquely fix it.\\

In $\mathcal{N}=1$ language (which we employ even though the model has $\mathcal{N}=4$) the theory describes the dynamics of $U(N)$ gauge vector supermultiplets $A_\mu$ and three complex chiral superfields $(X^a)_{i\dot j}$, $a=1,2,3$ in the adjoint of the gauge group (we will frequently omit gauge indices). These are nothing else than the parametrization of the D3-branes' position in $\mathbb{C}^3$ and therefore transform in the fundamental of $SU(3)$. The superpotential is the only one allowed by gauge and $SU(3)$ invariance:

\begin{equation} W(X) = \epsilon_{abc} \Tr ( X^a X^b X^c) \end{equation}

\section{Orbifolds}

\section{The conifold and the Klebanov-Witten model}

In \cite{KW_SCFT} the case of $X_6$ being the conifold was studied. The conifold is a specific Calabi-Yau 3-cone defined for example as the following variety in $\mathbb{C}^4$:

\begin{equation}
	z_1^2 + z_2^2 + z_3^2 + z_4^2 = 0
\end{equation}

This is notably not an orbifold of $\mathbb{C}^3$. The base can be found by quotienting by dilations $z_i \rightarrow \lambda z_i$ (with $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}_+$) and turns out to be the homogeneous space $SO(4)/U(1) = SU(2)\times SU(2) / U(1)$, where the $U(1)$ is a diagonal subgroup generated by, say, $T^3_L + T^3_R$. We will therefore have $SU(2)\times SU(2)$ as part of the isometry group of both $Y_5$ and $X_6$. An equivalent description of the topology of the conifold is as a $U(1)$ bundle over $\mathbb{C}P^1 \times \mathbb{C}P^1$; in these terms the metric on the base that makes the cone Calabi-Yau is

\begin{equation}
	ds^2_5 = \frac{1}{9} (d\psi + \cos\theta_1 d\phi_1 + \cos\theta_2 d\phi_2)^2 + \frac{1}{6} (d\Omega_1^2 + d\Omega_2^2)
\end{equation}

where $\Omega_i^2 = d\theta_i^2 + \sin\theta_i^2 d\phi_i^2$ is the metric on the $\mathbb{C}P^1_i$, and $\psi$ is the fibral coordinate with period $4\pi$.
